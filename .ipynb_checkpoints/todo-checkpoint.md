## a todolist and notes for changes

I'm trying to explore what the [osmx package](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/osmnx.html) is a capable of. I think my current goal is be able to input a city name and do the roading analysis automatically.  Also i want to compare my method to the other method used for street type determination.
