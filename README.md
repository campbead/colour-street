# Colour Streets

Colour Street draws a colour-coded street network of a city. It was originally done by @puntofisso but I made few changes and upgrades. The [example notebook](https://github.com/saeidadli/colour-street/blob/master/ipynb/Street%20colouring.ipynb) works for Auckland and should work for other cities too.
